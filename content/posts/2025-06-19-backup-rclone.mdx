## Prerequisites

Make sure you have access to both your MinIO server and a Jottacloud account.

## Install rclone

First, install rclone using the following command. For more information, see the [official rclone installation guide](https://rclone.org/install/).

```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Configure rclone

Run the configuration command:

```bash
rclone config
```

See the [official guide for setting up rclone and Jottacloud](https://rclone.org/jottacloud/).

### Add Jottacloud Remote

1. Choose `n` for a new remote.
2. Enter a name for the remote, e.g., `jottacloud`.
3. Select `Jottacloud` as the storage type.
4. Leave client_id and client_secret blank.
5. Select no for advanced config.

Jottacloud has different options for authentication, based on your provider. I use the `jottacloud` provider.

```bash
Option config_type.
Select authentication type.
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value of type string.
Press Enter for the default (standard).
   / Standard authentication.
 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.
   \ (standard)
   / Legacy authentication.
 2 | This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.
   \ (legacy)
   / Telia Cloud authentication.
 3 | Use this if you are using Telia Cloud (Sweden).
   \ (telia_se)
   / Telia Sky authentication.
 4 | Use this if you are using Telia Sky (Norway).
   \ (telia_no)
   / Tele2 Cloud authentication.
 5 | Use this if you are using Tele2 Cloud.
   \ (tele2)
   / Onlime Cloud authentication.
 6 | Use this if you are using Onlime Cloud.
   \ (onlime)
config_type> 1
```

- Follow the directions to create a new token and paste it in when prompted.
- Select yes for using a non-sta device/mountpoint. Select default jotta.
- Select Archive for the config-mountpoint.

### Add MinIO Remote

1. Run `rclone config` again.
2. Choose `n` for a new remote.
3. Enter a name for the remote, e.g., `minio`.
4. Select **Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers** as the storage type.
5. Select `MinIO` as the provider.
6. Select 'Enter AWS credentials in the next step.' for adding the credentials in the prompt.
7. Enter your MinIO access key and secret key.
8. Enter a region, e.g., `us-east-1`.
9. Enter the endpoint URL for your MinIO server, e.g., `http://minio`.
10. Select the strictest ACL option for creating new buckets as convenient.
11. Select no for advanced config.

## Troubleshooting: Cloudflare Tunnel 403 Error

If your MinIO server is behind a Cloudflare tunnel and you experience 403 errors, add the following option to your rclone command:

```bash
--s3-sign-accept-encoding=false
```

## Backup Command Example

To back up a bucket from MinIO to Jottacloud, use the following command:

```bash
rclone sync minio:bucket jottacloud:backup --s3-sign-accept-encoding=false
```
